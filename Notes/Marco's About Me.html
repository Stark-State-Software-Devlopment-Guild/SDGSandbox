<h1>Gianmarco Tarantino</h1>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>My first experience in coding was an intro to C++ class I took in high school in 2012.Although I did not pursue anything more until I first started college in 2015, I now have experience in the following languages:</p>
<ol>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
</ol>
<p>My major is currently Computer Science, however I will add a Video Game Design and Development major next semester, I'm very excited for those classes!</p>
<p>I have always loved video games however as I got older I became more interested in the software development behind them.</p>
<p>In the last couple years I have started thinking critically about the theory behind game design and what it is that makes a good game, good.</p>
<p>Personally I am very laid back, but that doesn't mean I don't get passionate about things that excite me.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Get a Bachelor's Degree in Video Game Design and Development</li>
    <li>Create my own video game.</li>
</ul>
